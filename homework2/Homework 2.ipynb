    "1a) Explain the following terms with a few sentences and/or a simple diagram: (10 pts)\n",
    "- Trade winds: the trade winds are a term used to describe East to West winds near the equator. Trade winds are caused by a combination of coriolis and Hadley Cell circulation. In the Southern Hemisphere, the trades blow towards the North-West, while the trades in the Northern Hemisphere blow towards the South-West.\n",
    "- Hadley Circulation: Hadley circulation describes air circulation near the equator caused by Hadley cells. Essentially, air near the equator is often low-pressure and hot, caused by trade winds as well as more radiaton from the sun. This causes air to rise near the equator, where it then moves towards the poles at a high altitude, where it cools and descends before getting pushed back towards the equator.\n",
    "- Walker Circulation: Walker circulation describes air circulation from the Americas eastwards across the Pacific. It is caused by cool zones on the West of the Americas causing air to be pushed East, aided by the trade winds, until it reaches warmer waters where it will rise, go West, and then fall, continuing the cycle.\n",
